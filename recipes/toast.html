        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>chipotle chilli paste</li>
        <li>200g can chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 x 400g cans of beans</li>

        <li>150g grated cheddar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat and fry the onion for 8-10 mins until softened and slightly caramelised. Add the garlic and spices, the chipotle chilli paste or chilli flakes, if using, and some seasoning. Fry for a few minutes more until the mixture is fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes, then swirl out the pan using 100ml water and add this too. Simmer for 10-15 mins until the mixture has thickened. Blitz the sauce using a hand blender, then taste for seasoning. Tip in the beans and mix well to coat. Warm through over a medium heat for 5 mins until the beans are piping hot.</li>
        <li>Heat the grill to high and toast the bread slices for 3-5 mins. Top with the beans and grated cheese, and pop under the grill until the cheese is melted and bubbling. Sprinkle with a little paprika and serve immediately.</li>
